# weatherAPI
This weather app is incomplete. The app uses Openweathermap.org api to gather two sets of information. One for current weather and the longitude and latittude of the city. The longitude and lattitude are used to pinpoint the data for the next five days in their second API.

This app uses Jquery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. The user can expect to type in a city but not have the search history properly functioning. After typing in the valid city. The results will pop up for the current weather conditions and the conditions for the next five days. 

The emojis dictating the weather status are not avaliable.
